		<text>The minimum invasion size factor. A random number between the minimum and maximum invasion size factors is multiplied by the calculated invasion size to give the number of squads that a base will invade with. The size of the invasion force is calculated using the max capacity of the target location, reinforcement potential of any enemy locations near the target, the relative difference in squad power between the factions, and these min/max factors. The invasion size cannot be more than twice the maximum capacity of the origin base (ex: if a base with max capacity of 2 plans to invade a target with max capacity of 5, the invasion can be no larger than 4 squads). If this limitation prevents a small base from planning an adequate invasion, that base will instead contribute squads to a larger nearby base's invasion force.</text>

This value is also used for defense to determine the desired power factor versus incoming enemy forces: a value of 1.5 means that the defending base will try to call reinforcements to get a power advantage 1.5x that of the enemy invasion.</text>

Once defeated, they have a chance for a 'resurgence', where a large attack force appears in an attempt to capture a random enemy base on the map. The timer for this attack depends on the minimum and maximum resurgence times. Additionally, there is a chance that the resurgence attempt will be skipped over: a resurgence chance of 50 will skip half of all resurgence attempts, while a resurgence chance of 0 will always skip attempts (as if the faction is permanently defeated).</text>
